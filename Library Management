Write a program to implement a Library Management 
System with the following features:

It should contains Books where each Book has a name , an author  and price. 

All the books must be unique i.e. it should not accept a Book if it is already present

Retrieval of Book should be as fast as possible

The program should have 3 classes:
Book : should contain 3 data members called name , author and price . Also provide appropriate constructor and other important methods 

Library:  should contain a HashSet of Book . Also provide 3 methods called addBook( ), getBookCount() and getAllBooks( )

UseLibrary: This will be our driver class . It will contain code to create 4 Book objects , add them to the Library and display their details.
